  <h4> Hi there, I’m Murray.
While I’m studying as a full time student, I also work night shifts at Woolies, to fund my stupidly expensive hobbies. 
Oh yeah, and sometimes I play live music gigs. <br>
<br>	  
The first time I remember finishing an animation was way back in Year 8. I made a diorama, and built a little city using Megablocks – and then moved dinosaurs and cars around to make a stop-motion animation. It was like a really low budget Godzilla! <br>
	  
After that, I realized how fun this stuff can be, so – I decided to use more stop motion features as part of a music video I produced in Year 9.
In Year 11, we dipped our toes in the water – for the monster that is Adobe Animate. I knew we were going to be spending a lot of time together in Year 12… So I at least learnt how to use basic tweening, keyframes, all that fun stuff. <br> 
	  
In Year 12 I was lucky enough to be part of VET/VCE Creative and Digital Media, where I got to animate a trailer for my best-selling game ‘Egor’ – by using 2D animation. 
I remember back in the day, at just 8 years old - when I used to get on my Dad’s old laptop – fire up PowerPoint, and make massive stop-motion animations by duplicating the slides and moving the objects on screen pixel-by-pixel. <br> 
	  
I think this is probably where I realized how cool of an art-form animation can be. It’s a great way to express yourself, or the stories you have to tell, from the comfort of your desk chair.  <br> 
Unlike film, where you have to organize other cast and crew, and actually leave the house to produce a film – animation is a very convenient way to build characters and settings just the way you envisage. <br>
Of all my animations, I’m definitely most proud of the trailer I made for ‘Egor’. The entire project took me like a bajillion hours to finish, because I was being so fussy about every little detail.  <br>	  
This definitely made me appreciate the amount of effort that goes into big-budget animated movies.
I was pretty impressed with Disney’s recent remake of ‘The Lion King’. It’s pretty crazy how someone sat at their computer for countless hours – making drawings that made Simba look like a real-life kitty cat. <br>
<br>
I’ve recently picked up an interest in film based projects, like music videos and short films, but also still really enjoy rehearsing, performing, and recording live music. My hope is to be able to do both of these outside of school one day. <br>
<br>	  
Like every computer nerd, I love my video games. I’ve been playing a lot of CS:GO, and have made a few montages, which have turned out to be a great way to practise my editing.
Just to make my hobbies even more expensive, I decided that I would require a decent computer to work efficiently. So of course, I studied computer hardware, and built my own PC. It’s really not that hard – but it sounds cool at family functions. <br>
