				<p><b>Egor - Synopsis</b>
					<br>
					<br> 
					A species of monster lived happily on Earth for millions of years, before the human race came along and hunted them for their soft and durable fur. Over a period of time, the monster became what was thought to be extinct. 
					<br>
					<br>
					With one remaining of the species – unknown to humans, he lived alone for 20 years on an island. Eventually, the island on which he lived was invaded by humans and turned into a city. As a result, during a deforestation the monster was found after his home was destroyed. Now, he lives in a Zoo amongst other endangered monsters. Others from his species were labelled as aggressive and dangerous. Unlike them, Egor (the name given to this monster) is friendly and gentle, but humans are simply unaware of it. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Because he is alone, he is an easy target from other animals – who bully him and threaten him. Because of this, he becomes depressed, and wants to live happily like the humans he sees outside his enclosure. He wants to be able to live like all the humans – in a functional society. After living in his enclosure for years, he takes his only possession – a teddy bear a little girl gave to him, and escapes from his enclosure. He proceeds to live in an apartment building. Wearing casual, human clothes to try and blend in with the humans. With this, he is able to successfully live like a human being, given that he doesn’t get caught…

				<p><b>Art Style</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					The art style I am attempting to achieve, is inspired by clip-art aesthetic. By implementing finer detail to the main subject (Egor), than the rest of the frame, it will hopefully  direct the audience attention to the main subject. In animated films such as Detective Pikachu, Madagascar, and The Lorax; there is a distinct contrast between the dull industrial backgrounds, and the main focus. This contrast is generally produced through an orange/yellow colour, being paired with the dark and dull setting – to represent their positivity, joy, and happiness when surrounded by a dark and negative environment.
					<br>
					<br>
					The colour palettes used in Adventure time are very bright and attractive. With this, the scenery always appears to be happy and exciting.
					The realism in the fur on characters such as Pikachu from ‘Detective Pikachu’, and the chickens from ‘Hop’ – give the characters a distinct fluffiness and welcomingness.
					<br>
					I wanted to try and implement this into my character Egor, to show that; whilst he appears to be scary and intimidating to the general public – he is in fact friendly, gentle, and approachable.
					<br>
					<br>
					When travelling to New York on a study tour, I found that the light of the sunset flowing between the buildings was very appealing. The gradient from blue to orange to dark purple made very a very aesthetic colour palette, which I would attempt to implement into my animation. 
					I had intended to use my knowledge and skills from film and media studies throughout this animation. With these skills, I wanted to implement a clear use of visual composition through rule of thirds, symmetry, headspace, etc. 
					Throughout my animation, I wanted to use lighting and shadows to my advantage. This can be distinctly seen when Egor is first presented as a scary and intimidating silhouette, hiding in the shadows. This is quickly contradicted using lighting, as he is displayed as a friendly character once absent from the shadows.
					<br>
					<br>
					Sound and Music played a leading factor in the immersion of my animation. I ensured I included a series of sound effects such as footsteps, dialogue, creaking doors, city ambience, crowd murmuring, etc.
					I had also elected that I record my own dialogue, for the sounds produced by Egor. Given that I was unable to locate anything fitting online, I chose to produce my own noises, to suit what I had envisaged.
					Segments of different musical scores were implemented depending on the mood of the scene. For example, the escape scene included intense chase music, and the city scenes had devious, yet calm and sarcastic music. 
					<br>
					<br>
					With the inclusion of planning, designing, modelling, animating, and editing – This project involved upwards of 100 hours of work to complete.

				<p><b>Software List</b>
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Microsoft Word </u>
					<br>
					Word will be used during the planning stage, to write out each of the pre-production modules – before moving them into the PowerPoint. This will make it much easier to read and edit the text, without having to deal with formatting. 
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Microsoft PowerPoint </u>
					<br>
					PowerPoint is the program being used to display the final product of the pre/post production. This is where all the modules will be displayed in their final form. With this in mind, this PowerPoint will be referred to throughout the production of the animation itself.
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Adobe Photoshop </u>
					<br>
					Photoshop will be used to produce assets that will be used in the trailer. This may involve making assets from scratch using shapes, or modifying royalty-free assets that were sourced online. Furthermore, all the backgrounds for my trailer will be created in Photoshop.
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Adobe Animate </u>
					<br>
					This is where the majority of the work will take place. All of the assets created will be imported into Animate, to move or transform the assets and backgrounds accordingly – using tweens or modifying other properties.
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Ableton Live </u>
					<br>
					Ableton will be used to record audio for the ‘dialogue’ of the main character Egor. While no actual words are spoken, Egor makes a series of groaning noises – which will be recorded from a condenser microphone, into an Audio Interface, before being fed into the computer running Ableton.
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Adobe Media Encoder </u>
					<br>
					Encoder is the program that will be used to convert the animation from an MOV file to an MP4. This will make the file readable, meaning that it can be watched, and modified in other programs. By using Media Encoder, the file will also be condensed, meaning that backing up and transporting will be much more efficient. 
					<br>
					<br>
				<u> Adobe Premiere Pro </u>
					<br>
					Premiere Pro will be used to apply sound effects and music to the animation. This will be used for sound as opposed to Animate, as it has a much broader range of capabilities including volume, speed, pitch, etc. The text in the title scene will also be applied in Premiere Pro, as the text can be more easily edited and moved.
